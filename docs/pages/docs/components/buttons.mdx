## Elevated button

Elevated buttons are essentially filled tonal buttons with a shadow. To prevent
shadow creep, only use them when absolutely necessary, such as when the button
requires visual separation from a patterned background.

```jsx
<Stack direction="row" spacing={2}>
  <Button variant="elevated">Elevated button</Button>
  <Button variant="elevated" icon={<Add />}>
    Elevated button
  </Button>
</Stack>
```

## Filled button

Filled buttons have the most visual impact after the FAB, and should be used for
important, final actions that complete a flow, like **Save**, **Join now**, or
**Confirm**.

```jsx
<Stack direction="row" spacing={2}>
  <Button variant="filled">Filled button</Button>
  <Button variant="filled" icon={<Add />}>
    Filled button
  </Button>
</Stack>
```

## Filled tonal button

A filled tonal button is an alternative middle ground between filled and
outlined buttons. They're useful in contexts where a lower-priority button
requires slightly more emphasis than an outline would give, such as "Next" in an
onboarding flow. Tonal buttons use the secondary color mapping.

```jsx
<Stack direction="row" spacing={2}>
  <Button variant="tonal">Tonal button</Button>
  <Button variant="tonal" icon={<Add />}>
    Tonal button
  </Button>
</Stack>
```

## Outlined button

Outlined buttons are medium-emphasis buttons. They contain actions that are
important, but aren't the primary action in an app.

Outlined buttons pair well with filled buttons to indicate an alternative,
secondary action.

```jsx
<Stack direction="row" spacing={2}>
  <Button variant="outlined">Outlined button</Button>
  <Button variant="outlined" icon={<Add />}>
    Outlined button
  </Button>
</Stack>
```

## Text button

Text buttons are used for the lowest priority actions, especially when
presenting multiple options.

Text buttons can be placed on a variety of backgrounds. Until the button is
interacted with, its container isn't visible.

```jsx
<Stack direction="row" spacing={2}>
  <Button variant="text">Text button</Button>
  <Button variant="text" icon={<Add />}>
    Text button
  </Button>
</Stack>
```
