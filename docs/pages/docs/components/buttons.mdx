There are five types of common buttons: elevated, filled, filled tonal,
outlined, and text.

## Usage

Buttons have label text that describes the action that will occur if a user taps
a button.

```jsx
<Stack direction="row" spacing={2}>
  <OutlinedButton>Back</OutlinedButton>
  <FilledButton>Complete</FilledButton>
</Stack>
```

### Icon

An icon may optionally be added to a button to help communicate the button's
action and help draw attention.

```jsx
<ElevatedButton
  icon={
    <svg fill="currentColor" viewBox="0 0 48 48">
      <path d="M6 40V8l38 16Zm3-4.65L36.2 24 9 12.5v8.4L21.1 24 9 27Zm0 0V12.5 27Z" />
    </svg>
  }
>
  Send
</ElevatedButton>
```

## Accessibility

Add an `aria-label` attribute to buttons whose labels need a more descriptive
label.

```jsx live=false
<ElevatedButton aria-label="Add a new contact">Add</ElevatedButton>
```

## Elevated button

Elevated buttons are essentially filled tonal buttons with a shadow. To prevent
shadow creep, only use them when absolutely necessary, such as when the button
requires visual separation from a patterned background.

```jsx
<Stack direction="row" spacing={4}>
  <ElevatedButton>Elevated button</ElevatedButton>
  <ElevatedButton icon={<Add />}>Elevated button</ElevatedButton>
</Stack>
```

## Filled button

Filled buttons have the most visual impact after the FAB, and should be used for
important, final actions that complete a flow, like **Save**, **Join now**, or
**Confirm**.

```jsx
<Stack direction="row" spacing={4}>
  <FilledButton>Filled button</FilledButton>
  <FilledButton icon={<Add />}>Filled button</FilledButton>
</Stack>
```

## Filled tonal button

A filled tonal button is an alternative middle ground between filled and
outlined buttons. They're useful in contexts where a lower-priority button
requires slightly more emphasis than an outline would give, such as "Next" in an
onboarding flow. Tonal buttons use the secondary color mapping.

```jsx
<Stack direction="row" spacing={4}>
  <TonalButton>Tonal button</TonalButton>
  <TonalButton icon={<Add />}>Tonal button</TonalButton>
</Stack>
```

## Outlined button

Outlined buttons are medium-emphasis buttons. They contain actions that are
important, but aren't the primary action in an app.

Outlined buttons pair well with filled buttons to indicate an alternative,
secondary action.

```jsx
<Stack direction="row" spacing={4}>
  <OutlinedButton>Outlined button</OutlinedButton>
  <OutlinedButton icon={<Add />}>Outlined button</OutlinedButton>
</Stack>
```

## Text button

Text buttons are used for the lowest priority actions, especially when
presenting multiple options.

Text buttons can be placed on a variety of backgrounds. Until the button is
interacted with, its container isn't visible.

```jsx
<Stack direction="row" spacing={4}>
  <TextButton>Text button</TextButton>
  <TextButton icon={<Add />}>Text button</TextButton>
</Stack>
```

export default ({ children }) => <Layout meta={meta}>{children}</Layout>
